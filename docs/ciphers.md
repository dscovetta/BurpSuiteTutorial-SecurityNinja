List of Ciphers and Codes (All Types with Examples)
===================================================

Ciphers form the basis of cryptography. This is a list of ciphers and codes, those that need a key for encryption-decryption process and also simple ciphers.

Before listing **all cipher types and codes** I would like to explain the most important terms and concepts in encryption.

**Cipher or cypher** – is mathematical formula or an algorithm that is done step by step for encryption and decryption of a message.

**Plaintext** – refers to the message in its original or decrypted form before transforming it into an unreadable form. The sender encrypts the message using a secret key before sending it to the recipient or receiver.

**[Ciphertext](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ciphertext)** – is a scrambled message resulting from transformations done on the plain text.

**Decipher or decode** – is simply a way to decrypt or revert the encrypted text into the readable form.

**Cryptanalysis or [code-breaking](http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/)** – is the process used to solve or break a cryptosystem with or without a key. Cracking is mostly achieved through techniques like brute force and letter [frequency analysis](https://learncryptography.com/attack-vectors/frequency-analysis)

**Cryptanalyst or code breaker** – is an attacker aiming to crack secret messages exchanged between two or more parties with or without the encryption key. The intercept is cracked by using frequency distribution based on the letters of the alphabet.

**Encryption or ciphering** – is the process of converting text to unreadable form using a secure encryption scheme and a secret key.

**A cryptographer or code maker** – develops algorithms and systems that aim to keep data and information security.

**Cryptology** is the mathematics, such as number theory, and the application of formulas and algorithms, that underpin cryptography and cryptanalysis.

**Cryptography** often referred to as **crypto** is the art and science used to conceal messages to introduce secrecy in information.

**Steganography** is a technique used to [hide information in plain sight](https://www.wired.com/story/steganography-hacker-lexicon/) by embedding it in a file such as a picture. In this technique data, is not encrypted before it’s transmitted but relies only the upon message being undetectable.

Most **common types of ciphers and codes** are easy to implement and break while others are very complicated and have a high degree of complexity. Thus, deciphering these types of ciphers by pen and paper is very hard and therefore, a computer is needed.

However, there exist many tips and tricks you can use to [figure out the cipher used](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier) to encode a message. To date may ciphers have been solved but there is still a small number of famous secret codes that [remain unsolved and unbroken](https://www.wired.com/2012/12/codes/).

Is there a difference between codes and ciphers?

Codes are basically concerned with **semantics** while ciphers emphasize **syntax and symbols**. With codes, specified strings of keywords are stored in a [codebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebook) hence faster while cryptographic ciphers are controlled by a set of steps or an algorithm.

For example, using codes I would encode the phrase (**kifanga**), with the digits (25).

Here is a **list of 110 ciphers and codes** used from the historical ages to modern times organized in different types and categories.
